User is a person who wants to get access.
Consumer is an application or website that uses OAuth to access the Service Provider.
Service Provider is a web application that allows access via OAuth.
Protected Resource is the data the user wants to access.
Tokens
OAuth 1 Authorization uses Request Token and Access Token to get access to the resources on the resource server.

Request Token – a token containing Consumer Key and Consumer Secret used to ask the service for authorization.

The tokens can have different formats and structures based on the service provider security requirements.
